Survival Game Template
=============
 
### About
This is a Multiplayer Survival Game Template that I created in Unreal Engine 4.

My goal with this project was almost entirely educational. Before this project I had barely any experience with a networked multiplayer game.

I am well aware that this is not a pretty, or even a fun game. I was using this project as a learning experiment and it succeeded great in that!


### Features
- Replicated Movement (Sprinting/Walking/Jumping/Crouching)
- Player Stats (Health/Hunger/Thirst/Stamina)
- Scalable Gun and Ammo System (Guns can easily be added with different ammo types, although only one type is used in this template)
- Inventory System (Player and Containers)
Pickup Items (Pickup Items that can be used to alter player stats, or dropped)
- Reloading
- Dedicated Server
- Server Browser

### Server Info

I have hardcoded a Dedicated Server that I have set up to run on AWS into the server browser. Feel free to download and run the server on your own system to test it out using the local server option,
or set up your own hosted server for your friends to join.

### Thank You
